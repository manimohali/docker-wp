The error you are encountering is because the port 443 is still being used by the previous instance of the `docker-proxy` process, even after you brought down the Docker container. This can happen if Docker doesn't fully clean up the processes related to the container.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

### Step 1: Stop All Docker Containers
First, ensure all running containers are stopped. Use the following command:
```sh
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
```

### Step 2: Remove All Containers
Remove all containers to ensure there are no lingering processes:
```sh
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

### Step 3: Kill Remaining Docker Processes
If the port is still occupied, kill any lingering `docker-proxy` processes manually:
```sh
sudo kill $(sudo lsof -t -i:443)
```

### Step 4: Restart Docker Service
Restart the Docker service to ensure it starts fresh:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Step 5: Verify Port is Free
Verify that port 443 is free before starting your containers again:
```sh
sudo netstat -plntu | grep :443
```
There should be no output for port 443 at this point.

### Step 6: Recreate Docker Containers
Now, recreate your Docker containers using `docker-compose`:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Explanation
- **Stopping and removing containers** ensures that no old containers are holding onto the port.
- **Killing the `docker-proxy` process** manually frees up the port if it is still being used.
- **Restarting the Docker service** ensures that Docker itself isn't holding onto old state information.
- **Verifying the port** ensures that your system is in the correct state before starting the containers again.

This process should resolve the issue of the port being occupied by a stale `docker-proxy` process. If the problem persists, consider checking Docker logs and system logs for further insight into what might be holding onto the port.
