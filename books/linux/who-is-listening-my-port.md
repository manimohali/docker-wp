To identify which application is listening on port 443, you can use the `netstat` or `ss` command with additional options to show the process name and PID. Here's how you can do it:

### Using `netstat`

1. Run the following command to find the process listening on port 443:

    ```bash
    sudo netstat -plntu | grep :443
    ```

   This will provide details about the process, including the PID and the program name.

### Using `ss`

1. Alternatively, you can use the `ss` command, which is a modern replacement for `netstat`:

    ```bash
    sudo ss -plntu | grep :443
    ```

   This will also give you the details about the process listening on port 443.

### Example Output

For both commands, you should see an output similar to this:

```plaintext
tcp6       0      0 :::443                  :::*                    LISTEN      1234/apache2
```

In this example, the process with PID 1234 (which is `apache2`) is listening on port 443.

### Using `lsof`

1. Another useful tool is `lsof` (list open files), which can also show network connections:

    ```bash
        
    ```

   This will list all processes listening on port 443 and provide detailed information about them.

### Example Output

The `lsof` command will output something like this:

```plaintext
COMMAND   PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
apache2  1234  root    4u  IPv6  12345      0t0  TCP *:https (LISTEN)
```

In this output, the `apache2` process with PID 1234 is listening on port 443.

By using any of these methods, you can determine which application is currently listening on port 443 and take appropriate actions if necessary.
